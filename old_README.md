# MolSysViewer

*A Mol*-powered interactive viewer for molecular systems and trajectories,
designed for general use and for seamless integration with the MolSys
ecosystem.*

MolSysViewer is an interactive molecular visualization tool built on top of the
Mol* engine. It can be used as a general-purpose viewer for molecular
structures, PDB files, trajectories and 3D overlays, without requiring any
additional tools. At the same time, it provides seamless optional integration
with the MolSys ecosystem, supporting advanced representations produced by
MolSysMT, TopoMT, ElastNetMT, PharmacophoreMT and future modules. Through a
clean Python API and a custom Jupyter widget, MolSysViewer delivers
high-quality rendering, dynamic visualizations and an extensible architecture
suitable for research, teaching and drug-design workflows.
