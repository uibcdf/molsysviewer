# Developer Guide

This directory contains internal design, planning, and architectural documents
for this project. It is intended for **developers and contributors**, not for
end users.

The structure is designed to be reusable across the MolSys ecosystem
(e.g., MolSysMT, TopoMT, MolSysViewer, PharmacophoreMT, etc.).

## Layout

- `DESIGN/` — high-level design, architecture, and major decisions.
- `PLANNING/` — roadmap, next steps, and release planning.
- `STRUCTURE/` — current repository layout and module overview.
- `HISTORY/` — checkpoints and historical notes.

## How to use this guide

1. Start with `DESIGN/OVERVIEW.md` to understand what the project is about.
2. Read `STRUCTURE/REPO_STRUCTURE.md` to see how the code is organized.
3. Follow `PLANNING/ROADMAP.md` to understand where the project is going.
4. Use `HISTORY/` to revisit past states or major transitions.

Replace the project-specific placeholders in these files with the actual
information for each repository.
