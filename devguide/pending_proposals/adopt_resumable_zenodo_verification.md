# Adopt resumable read-only Zenodo verification

**Reported:** 2026-10-01, common recovery work under uibcdf/molsyssuite#49.
**Status:** Active; implementation prepared, exact-commit hosted verification pending.

## What

Adopt the common provider rather than another component-local retry algorithm.
Replace the 900-second release wait with one bounded probe, scheduled complete
discovery and manual exact-tag verification. Preserve explicit archival states.

## How

The caller pins `b78fa9d30d46ce5607999cdecae85cf6c03f5fcd`, stable concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.18072956`, and a fixed
2026-09-25 coverage cutoff. It handles published releases, public prereleases,
six-hour schedules and manual dispatch. The common job checks out its own pinned
source, not the component's commit, and queries only public facts. The local
normative citation contract routes sign-off through explicit verified evidence.

## Why

The paired public archives appeared about 87 minutes after publication, beyond
the old 15-minute window. A pending archive or inconclusive service query must
not become a permanent absence claim or prompt duplicate publication.

## What is measured and what is assumed

The central provider passed thirteen semantic tests and the complete 177-test
central suite; direct public checks matched both paired releases. Local adoption
is configuration inspection until the published hosted run completes. A 72-hour
deadline is a maintainer intervention threshold, not a Zenodo service guarantee.

## What was refuted

Long runner sleeps waste resources. Rolling lookbacks can drop overdue work.
Green jobs with pending evidence cannot complete archival sign-off. Replaying
accepted hooks or deposits is unnecessary for read-only recovery.

## Scope and exclusions

Release verification, contributor operation and reporting governance. No release
publication, package promotion, scientific execution or product code changes.

## Acceptance criteria

Published caller uses the immutable provider; local reporting/index guards pass;
hosted exact-tag and covered-release scan pass with native verified states and
the exact source file identity. Archive this report with hosted evidence and the
local normative contract, preserving scientific review deferrals.

## Dependencies and risks

The caller relies on GitHub scheduling and anonymous Zenodo queries; failures
remain visible. Maintainers own overdue follow-up and manual dispatch. Central
request/discovery bounds must not silently omit a covered release.

## Provenance

2026-10-01, Python 3.13.15, isolated checkout from refreshed main. Original member
worktrees are preserved. Publication/hosted measurements are recorded at closure.
