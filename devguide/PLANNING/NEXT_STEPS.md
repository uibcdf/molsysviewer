# Next Steps

Use this file for short-term, concrete tasks that are too detailed or volatile
for the main roadmap.

- [ ] Example: Implement initial shape primitives.
- [ ] Example: Add unit tests for core API.
- [ ] Example: Write first tutorial notebook.

When tasks become stable or long-term, promote them into `ROADMAP.md`.
